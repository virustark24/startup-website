## A quick note:

* This website is my first startup project on GitHub and on the internet for that matter.  
* I've used a basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript template to develop the front-end, keeping a modern design aesthetic in mind.  
* Your feedback would be highly appreciated! Feel free to get in touch using the contact details on my GitHub profile.
